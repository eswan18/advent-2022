# Advent of Code, 2022

My rules:
- Must parse the input exactly as-is. No modifying or hardcoding details, with the exception of the sizes of grids (e.g. how many rows and columns do I need to anticipate) though even that is frowned upon.
  - I always make two files: `test_input.txt` is the example input to test on, `input.txt` is the "real" input to the puzzle.
- Python-specific: Use version 3.10, no use of packages outside the standard library.
