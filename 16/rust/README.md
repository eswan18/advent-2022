For part B, I never got a solution that ran to completion without crashing (probably from memory overuse).
I think that my code has a bug resulting in it checking the same case multiple times, though I wasn't able to confirm that.

I worked around this (i.e. cheated) by just printing every flow rate at each step.
I ran the program with output directed into a file, then just found the max value in the file.
That answer turned out to be correct.
